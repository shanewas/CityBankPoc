-*- checks.py -*-

This module is where the developer will call all the different checks to be 
performed. Please note the wording ~call~. The developer is expected to 
write the actual checks in files inside the "checks" directory and call 
those functions from within this file.

Example:
    
    The example below is what the contents of this file are expected to look like
    As aforementioned, the developers are expected to call the previously written
    check functions here::

        # Here we are assuming that the developer is calling the method 
        # face_comparison() from the file awschecks.py - which has been imported
        # from the same directory
        $ response = face_comparison()
