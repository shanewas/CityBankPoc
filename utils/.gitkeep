-*- utils directory -*-

This directory is for storing all functional files that consist of common methods
to be called and used throughout the program. Developers are expected to maintain
separate files for each type of utilitarian method.

Example:
    
    The example below is what the contents of this directory are expected to look like.
    As aforementioned, the developers are expected to write all utilitarian functions 
    here::

    -> utils
        # Here, csv.py deals with all functions related to CSV's 
        # i.e. reading from and writing to CSV files
        -> csv.py 
        # Here, csv.py deals with all functions related to text files 
        # i.e. reading from and writing to .txt files
        -> text.py
